          Ever felt like you are playing the game of life on hard mode? As a
          software developer, I aim to create innovative solutions to solve
          complex problems and help others elevate to the next level. Becoming a
          software engineer has been a challenging and fulfilling journey, and I
          am currently looking for the next opportunity to enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adept at learning and driven to succeed, I taught myself to create
          databases using VBA and SQL. I used those skills to start as a Data
          Analyst for a local trash company. I excelled quickly with no prior
          industry knowledge and created many solutions to improve operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the systems I developed, I realized my passion for coding.
          Within the first year, I accomplished creating a database to track the
          company's truck information, automate calculating heavyweight taxes,
          and renewing registrations. I also developed a spreadsheet using VBA
          and Selenium to automate entering the tickets into their route
          manager. I was praised for autonomously managing their most profitable
          account and improving productivity through creative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focused with relentless optimism to pursue a new career, I enrolled at
          Thinkful, where I learned software development industry best practices
          and acquired knowledge of new languages and frameworks under the
          guidance of a senior software engineer in a mentor-student
          relationship. I am currently staying active in my trade by creating
          websites for local businesses and making others' lives easier. Do you
          share the same passion for creativity and helping others? If so, let's
          connect!
